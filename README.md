# List of Internet Service Providers
For a project, some years ago, I had to assemble a list of internet service providers (ISPs). While conducting research,, I stumbled upon this ISP list and decided to contribute it to GitHub. Unfortunately, I can't recall the original source for proper credit, but I'll acknowledge it as soon as I remember.
